This project is part of my portfolio for Data Science.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyse data from Space Missions.

### Methods Used
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, Plotly

## Project Description
I got CSV file with data about space missions, space organisations and prices per launch. I had to clean a data because not every mission has known price. I worked with two data sets. One with cleaned data where I removed rows with NaN price and second one with NaN prices.

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- data visualization
- writeup/reporting
